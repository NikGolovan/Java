**AutoSave** allows to save text whenever the button "Back" is clicked or if the application is closed. It helps to prevent information lost. **Warn before delete** is a useful function that prevents accidental or unnecessarily delete of a note. A dialog window pops up if the current option is activated before commit any changes in the database.

**Properties** allows user to customize the text size of notes. All changes are save automatically and dynamically. **Deleting of all notes** erases all notes from the database.
